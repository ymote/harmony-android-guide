## Implementable APIs (score >= 5): 4 methods

| Method | Signature | Score | Type | Effort | OH Equivalent | OH Signature |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `close` | `void close()` | 10 | direct | trivial | `close` | `close(fd: number): Promise<void>` |
| `open` | `void open()` | 10 | direct | trivial | `open` | `open(path: string, flags?: number, mode?: number): Promise<number>` |
| `ConditionVariable` | `ConditionVariable()` | 5 | partial | moderate | `triggerCondition` | `triggerCondition?: TriggerCondition` |
| `ConditionVariable` | `ConditionVariable(boolean)` | 5 | partial | moderate | `triggerCondition` | `triggerCondition?: TriggerCondition` |

## Stub APIs (score < 5): 2 methods

These methods have no feasible OH mapping. Stub them according to the stub strategy in the AI Agent Playbook.

| Method | Score | Type | Stub Strategy |
|---|---|---|---|
| `block` | 4 | partial | throw UnsupportedOperationException |
| `block` | 4 | partial | throw UnsupportedOperationException |

## AI Agent Instructions

**Scenario: S3 — Partial Coverage**

1. Implement 4 methods that have score >= 5
2. Stub 2 methods using the Stub Strategy column above
3. Every stub must either: throw UnsupportedOperationException, return safe default, or log+no-op
4. Document each stub with a comment: `// A2OH: not supported, OH has no equivalent`
5. Test both working methods AND verify stubs behave predictably

## Dependencies

Check if these related classes are already shimmed before generating `android.os.ConditionVariable`:


## Quality Gates

Before marking `android.os.ConditionVariable` as done:

1. **Compilation**: `javac` succeeds with zero errors
2. **API Surface**: All 6 public methods present (implemented or stubbed)
3. **Test Coverage**: At least 4 test methods for implemented APIs
4. **No Regression**: `test_pass >= baseline`, `test_fail <= baseline + 2`
5. **Mock Consistency**: Every OHBridge method has both declaration and mock
