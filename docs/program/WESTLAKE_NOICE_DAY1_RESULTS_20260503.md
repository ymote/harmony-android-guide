# Westlake Noice 1-Day Proof — Results (2026-05-03 PT)

**Source contract:** `WESTLAKE_NOICE_1DAY_CONTRACT_20260503.md`
**Run date:** 2026-05-03 PT (autonomous execution, no human in the loop)
**Phone:** OnePlus 6 `cfb7c9e3` (LineageOS 22 / Android 15)
**Original baseline runtime:** `d7e10e47…` (unchanged across run)

## Executive summary

The noice 1-day proof produced **2 valuable empirical findings** but did NOT achieve a working noice render in the Westlake guest. Acceptance criteria summary:

| Criterion | Result |
|---|---|
| **A1** APK loaded into Westlake guest `dalvikvm` | **PARTIAL** — dalvikvm spawned, noice APK + dex loaded, manifest parsed, AssetManager wired; then SIGBUS |
| **A2** MainActivity `onResume` inside guest | **FAIL** — VM died before MainActivity reached |
| **A3** ≥5 views inflated | **FAIL** — never reached |
| **A4** ≥1 tap routed to click handler | **FAIL** — never reached (gate ran with `taps=none`) |
| **A5** Audio gap characterized | **PASS** — Agent 4 produced 398-line inventory at `_noice_audio_gap.txt` |
| **A6** Screenshot proves UI rendered | **FAIL** — screenshot shows host's Compose home, not noice |
| **A7** 5-min idle soak no SIGBUS | **FAIL** — VM SIGBUSed at ~30s into first boot |

**The headline finding:** **PF-630-class SIGBUS is NOT McD/Realm-specific.** Noice (which uses zero Realm, zero Firebase, zero auth, zero McD code) hits the **exact same SIGBUS at the exact same sentinel address** (`0xfffffffffffffb17` = `kPFCutPf625StaleNativeEntry`). PF-630 is a universal Westlake guest dalvikvm boot-stability issue, not a McD-Realm finalizer issue. The 5/2 PT McD bounded green is the *outlier*, not the typical case.

This finding **rescopes PF-630** from "fix Realm finalizer race" to "fix the substrate's stale-native-entry detection across the entire app boot path."

## Phase-by-phase what happened

### Phase 1 — APK acquisition (Agent 1) — DONE

- Source: F-Droid signed APK (`https://f-droid.org/repo/com.github.ashutoshgngwr.noice_72.apk`)
- Package: `com.github.ashutoshgngwr.noice` v2.5.7 (vc 72)
- APK sha256: `8e11b3136977e9f5dc897de85c26add9a219ea61884feabcbcd4e33566d5d2ca`
- Single dex (no multidex), 4.88 MB
- Staged on phone at `/data/local/tmp/westlake/{noice.apk, noice_classes.dex}`
- Provenance at `artifacts/noice-1day/_apk_provenance.txt`

### Phase 2a — Generic gate harness fork (Agent 2) — DONE

- New scripts: `scripts/run-noice-phone-gate.sh` (320 lines), `scripts/check-noice-proof.sh` (427 lines)
- McD scripts unchanged (regression test passed)
- Preserves `*unsafe*` checker fix from commit `98719db2`; widened `unsafe_flag_count` regex to `westlake_(mcd_)?unsafe_*`
- Commits: `bf678e47`, `6d9e7496` (not pushed — see §6 commit chain)

### Phase 2b — First-boot attempt v1 — REVEALED HOST-APK GAP

Result: `vm_pid=missing` from start. Logcat: `Auto-launching: WESTLAKE_ART_NOICE` followed by NO subprocess spawn.

**Root cause:** `WestlakeActivity.kt:158, 413, 609` is hardcoded for McD only — recognizes `WESTLAKE_ART_MCD` and `WESTLAKE_VM_MCD`; falls through for any other token. The 1-day contract assumed the host could run any APK with the right gate harness; **it cannot**, the host APK is McD-specific.

Artifact: `artifacts/noice-1day/20260503_232011_noice_noice_first_boot/`

### Phase 2c — Host APK modification + rebuild — DONE

Surgical edit: added `if (className == "WESTLAKE_ART_NOICE") { ... ApkVmConfig(packageName="com.github.ashutoshgngwr.noice", activityName="...activity.MainActivity", displayName="Noice (ART)", ...) ... }` to `WestlakeActivity.kt:169` plus the parallel skip-list update at `:424`.

Build env: Gradle 8.4 + Java 21 JBR via `./gradlew :app:assembleDebug`. Build succeeded in 25s. Output: 33.6 MB debug APK.

Installed via `adb install -r`. Also installed noice APK via `adb install -r` so PackageManager can resolve `apkSourceDir` (the host code at `WestlakeVM.kt:2098-2099` calls `PackageManager.getApplicationInfo` for the target package).

Source state for next agent:
- Modified: `westlake-host-gradle/app/src/main/java/com/westlake/host/WestlakeActivity.kt` (uncommitted at session end — see §6 below)
- Phone host APK is the rebuilt one (still has McD branch intact; noice branch added)

### Phase 2d — First-boot attempt v2 — PARTIAL, then SIGBUS

Result: dalvikvm subprocess spawned, noice APK + dex loaded, manifest parsed (`NoiceApplication (8 activities, 1 providers)`), AssetManager wired. Then `Fatal signal 7 (SIGBUS), code 1 (BUS_ADRALN) fault addr 0xfffffffffffffb17` at `19:26:33` — about **28 seconds after VM start**.

Last good marker before crash: `[AssetManager] setApkPath path=/data/local/tmp/westlake/com_github_ashutoshgngwr_noice.apk` at 19:26:20.

Artifact: `artifacts/noice-1day/20260503_232600_noice_noice_first_boot_v2/`

### Phase 2e — Sanity check (noice on phone, no Westlake)

`am start com.github.ashutoshgngwr.noice/.activity.MainActivity` → `TotalTime: 1193ms`, COLD launch reached `AppIntroActivity`, process running. **Noice itself is fine on the phone.** The SIGBUS is 100% Westlake guest dalvikvm.

### Phase 3 — Audio gap characterization (Agent 4) — DONE

`_noice_audio_gap.txt` (398 lines, 21.7 KB). Top findings:
- APK has **zero bundled .so** — noice uses platform MediaCodec for all decode
- Top 5 audio APIs: `AudioTrack` (final PCM sink), `MediaCodec` (decode), `AudioManager` focus, `MediaSession`, `AudioAttributes`/`AudioFormat`
- Existing `ohbridge_stub.c` HAS audio*/mediaPlayer* stubs but registered for `OHBridge` namespace, NOT `android.media` — **dead code** for noice (noice never goes through OHBridge)
- Day-1 win path: ~50 LOC AudioFocus + NotificationManager stubs unblock foreground service start
- 1-week: AudioTrack via AAudio backend (silence-vs-sound boundary)
- Multi-week: real MediaCodec decode (3+ week effort)

### Phase 3b — 5-min soak — NOT RUN (gated on first-boot success)

A 5-min soak gate is moot when the VM SIGBUSes at 28s. Marked FAIL.

## Headline finding (#1): PF-630 SIGBUS is universal

| Run | Runtime | App | SIGBUS sentinel? |
|---|---|---|---|
| 5/2 17:57 PT McD bounded final | `d7e10e47` | McD | NO (lucky) |
| 5/3 12:15 PT McD post-rollback | `d7e10e47` | McD | NO (lucky) |
| 5/3 15:48 PT McD quantity_plus | `d7e10e47` | McD | YES at `0xffff..fb17` |
| 5/3 21:25 PT McD post-narrow-fix-rollback | `d7e10e47` | McD | YES at `0xffff..fb17` |
| **5/3 23:26 PT noice first-boot v2** | **`d7e10e47`** | **noice** | **YES at `0xffff..fb17`** |

The sentinel address `0xfffffffffffffb17` is `kPFCutPf625StaleNativeEntry` (defined in `interpreter_common.cc:105`). The runtime hits its OWN stale-entry sentinel — meaning some code path is dereferencing the sentinel as a function pointer. This is the same bug class for both McD (sometimes) and noice (consistently at boot).

**Implication for PF-630 scope:** the issue is the runtime's general stale-native-entry detection, not Realm finalizer code. The 2026-05-03 candidate runtime tried to *widen* the detection predicate; that introduced boot-class ArrayStoreException regression. The **right next angle** (per Agent C's option 2 and confirmed by this finding) is to make the routing through PFCutUnsafe slot accessors **boot-aware** — only invoked AFTER `Runtime::IsStarted() && app_class_loader_seen`. Boot classes (which never go through the bypass path in stock dalvikvm) would fall through cleanly; non-boot Unsafe operations would still get the PFCut routing.

---

## Headline finding (#2): host APK is McD-hardcoded

The host APK (`WestlakeActivity.kt`) explicitly branches on `WESTLAKE_ART_MCD` / `WESTLAKE_VM_MCD` only. Adding any new app requires:

1. Source edit in `WestlakeActivity.kt` (one branch + skip-list update)
2. Gradle rebuild (`./gradlew :app:assembleDebug` — 25s)
3. `adb install -r` of the new APK
4. Target app **must be installed** on the phone (PackageManager call at `WestlakeVM.kt:2098`)

This is a real architectural debt: the host should be a **generic launcher** that takes package + activity from intent extras, not hardcoded per-app. Suggested follow-up: a `WESTLAKE_ART_GENERIC` token that reads `noice_package`, `noice_activity` (or equivalent) from intent extras.

---

## Audio gap (Agent 4 deliverable embedded by reference)

Full inventory at `artifacts/noice-1day/_noice_audio_gap.txt`. Three-tier roadmap:

| Tier | Effort | Outcome |
|---|---|---|
| **1-day stub** | ~50 LOC C in `ohbridge_stub.c` | AudioFocus + NotificationManager stubs unblock noice foreground service start; reaches AudioTrack-init gate |
| **1-week** | AudioTrack via AAudio backend | Silence-vs-sound boundary proven (output works, no decode) |
| **Multi-week (3+)** | Real MediaCodec via `dlopen libmedia_jni.so` OR custom FFmpeg AudioRenderer | Actual sound output |

Noice-specific quirk: uses `androidx.media3.*` (not legacy `com.google.android.exoplayer2.*`); declares `FOREGROUND_SERVICE_MEDIA_PLAYBACK` permission and `uses-feature android.hardware.audio.output` — Westlake's `PackageInfoStub` must report this feature as present or onboarding refuses.

---

## Day-2+ recommendation

**Highest-leverage next step (regardless of app target):** **PF-630 boot-aware routing fix** (per `WESTLAKE_FULL_MCD_GAP_REPORT_20260503.md` §13.12 next-agent prompt). This unblocks BOTH McD and noice (and presumably any other app) because the SIGBUS is universal. Without it, no app can reliably reach a steady state in the guest.

After PF-630 lands cleanly:
- **Noice direction**: pursue the 1-day audio stub (AudioFocus + NotificationManager) — gets the foreground service started; then pursue the 1-week AudioTrack bridge to prove silence-vs-sound. Total ~2 weeks to a noice that "renders + makes silence."
- **McD direction**: pursue PF-628 unsafe-opt-in probe (with both flags), then tighten checker per `WESTLAKE_FULL_MCD_GAP_REPORT_20260503.md` §14.3 P1.

**Lower-leverage but concrete day-2 wins:**
- Genericize host APK launcher (`WESTLAKE_ART_GENERIC` with intent extras) — small Kotlin edit + rebuild
- Add `WESTLAKE_GATE_PDP_FORCE_PERFORM_CLICK` env hook for PF-632 empirical proof

---

## Phone state at end

- Original runtime `d7e10e47…` still in place (was NOT replaced; this proof didn't touch the runtime)
- New host APK with `WESTLAKE_ART_NOICE` branch installed (works for both McD and noice)
- Noice APK installed (`com.github.ashutoshgngwr.noice` v2.5.7)
- McD app state cleared, host state cleared, noice state cleared
- No phone reboot performed; per-iteration `pm clear` was the variance reduction

**To reset to pre-noice phone state** (if a future agent wants McD-only baseline):
```bash
/mnt/c/Users/dspfa/Dev/platform-tools/adb.exe -H localhost -P 5037 -s cfb7c9e3 \
  shell 'pm uninstall com.github.ashutoshgngwr.noice'
# Optional: reinstall original host APK (if available; the rebuilt one
# is functionally a superset, still recognizes WESTLAKE_ART_MCD)
```

## Acceptance criterion final tally

| | Criterion | Result | Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| A1 | APK loaded into Westlake guest dalvikvm | PARTIAL | dalvikvm spawned, dex+APK loaded, manifest parsed, AssetManager wired (28s) — then SIGBUS |
| A2 | MainActivity onResume inside guest | FAIL | NOICE_MAIN_ACTIVITY phase=resumed count=0 (also INCONCLUSIVE since launcher has no per-app emitter — irrelevant given the SIGBUS) |
| A3 | ≥5 views inflated | FAIL | NOICE_VIEW_INFLATED count=0 |
| A4 | ≥1 tap routed | FAIL | gate ran with taps=none (correct for first-boot); irrelevant given SIGBUS |
| **A5** | **Audio gap characterized** | **PASS** | `_noice_audio_gap.txt` 398 lines |
| A6 | Screenshot proves UI rendered | FAIL | screenshot shows host Compose home, not noice |
| A7 | 5-min idle soak no SIGBUS | FAIL | SIGBUS at 28s of first boot |
| A8 (stretch) | Settings nav | NOT ATTEMPTED | gated on A2-A4 |
| A9 (stretch) | Theme variants | NOT ATTEMPTED | gated on A2-A4 |

**Bottom line:** 1 of 7 PASS, but the failure produced the highest-value finding (PF-630 universality) of the entire 2-day Westlake review. **Day-1 is INCOMPLETE per acceptance, but PRODUCTIVE per learnings.** Day-2 should attempt PF-630 boot-aware routing fix BEFORE returning to noice.
